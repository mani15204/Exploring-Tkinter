# Exploring-Tkinter
This repository consists of basics of Tkinter

`Tkinter` is a default GUI (Graphical User Interface) library that comes bundled into Python for most operating systems. It provides a simple and easy-to-use way to create graphical interfaces in Python applications.

# Advantages of using Tkinter
- Need not install separately using pip.
- Tkinter works on Windows, macOS and Linux making it a versatile choice for cross-platform applications.
- Tkinter consists of the standard GUI widgets that you can use to build your applications
- Presence of trigger callbacks like button clicks or key presses makes it user-interactive.

# Explore Yourself!
I hope this repository brings you some basic understanding about Tkinter but I always prefer learning new modules from the Python Documentation itself. It provides rich content with ample examples. You may do it as well, with the help of help() function of python. Here's how you do it.

```
import tkinter
print(help(tkinter))
```

<br>Now let's say you don't know how to work with *Frames* in Tkinter. Then you have to do like this.

```
from tkinter import Frame
print(help(Frame))
```

<br>Now you may ask, "I don't even know till date that something called *Frames* is present under Tkinter". How will I even get to know all such things. Then you do this.
```
import tkinter
print(dir(tkinter))
```
